        "year": "2009",
        "abstract": "The paper attempts to investigate the influence of the 1988 Basel Accord on bank behavior and monetary policy. It is argued that the Accord was successful in that it forced commercial banks in all of G-10 countries to maintain higher capital ratios. Tentative research suggests, however, that – at least among American banks – the Accord also encouraged the widespread resort to regulatory capital arbitrage techniques, in particular securitization. The paper also reviews the literature on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and shows that the Basel Accord has affected the bank lending channel.",

        "abstract": "Containing short-term volatility of the overnight interest rate is normally considered the main objective of central bank standing facilities. This paper develops a simple stochastic model to show how the width of the central bank standing facilities corridor affects banks’ day-to-day liquidity management and the volatility of the overnight rate. It is shown that the wider the corridor, the greater the interbank turnover, the leaner the central bank’s balance sheet (i.e. the lower the average recourse to standing facilities) and the greater short-term interest rate volatility. The obtained relationships are matched with central bank preferences to obtain an optimal corridor width. The model is tested against euro area and Hungarian daily data encompassing the financial crisis that began in 2007.",

        "abstract": "Capital regulations stemming from the Basel accords created incentives for banks to securitize mortgages, even risky ones; hold them at a correspondingly low Basel risk weight; or shift them off of banks' balance sheets to obtain even greater leverage. Securitization was praised by economists and regulators for dispersing risks to investors across the world, providing greater resilience to the financial system. However, since in reality banks tended to hold onto securitized assets—either on their balance sheets or off of them, in off‐balance‐sheet entities—the accumulated credit risk remained with the banks, especially in the “shadow banking sector.” This explains the heightened vulnerability of the financial system to a sudden collapse.",

        "abstract": "After the Lehman default, but also during the euro area sovereign debt crisis, central banks have tended to extend the ability of banks to take recourse to central bank credit operations through changes of the collateral framework (e.g. CGFS, 2008 - in consistence with previous narratives, such as Bagehot, 1873). We provide a simple four sector model of the economy in which we illustrate the relevant trade-offs, derive optimal central bank collateral policies, and show why in a financial crisis, in which liquidity shocks become more erratic and the total costs of defaults increase, central banks may want to allow for greater potential recourse of banks to central bank credit. The model also illustrates that the credit riskiness of counterparties and issuers is endogenous to the central bank's credit policies and related risk control framework. Finally, the model allows identifying the circumstances under which the counterintuitive case arises in which a relaxation of the central bank collateral policy may reduce its expected losses.",

The model also allows understanding the link between this difference (the width of the central bank standing facilities corridor) and the stance of monetary policy, and how this link changes during a financial crisis. It is shown how the narrowing of the standing facilities corridor can make more accommodating the stance of monetary policy in a financial crisis.",

        "abstract": "Recent scholarship has underscored the possibility that capital-adequacy regulations may have contributed to the 2008 financial crisis by privileging highly rated asset-backed securities, such as mortgage-backed securities. The same regulations gave an even more privileged position to sovereign debt, leading to the question of whether they helped cause the European sovereign-debt crisis. There is little question that the regulations encouraged European banks to invest in European governments' bonds, but it does not appear that this encouragement led to more government borrowing by significantly reducing the yield governments needed to pay on their debt. However, it does appear that capital-adequacy regulations—along with post-2008 liquidity regulations—concentrated sovereign risk in the European banking system, aggravating the sovereign-debt problem by requiring government bailouts that, in turn …",

Although the NBP’s Monetary Policy Council has delivered a monetary easing cycle, policy rates in Poland remain above those of many peers, most notably the largest trading partner–the euro area. In this paper we seek to explain the motives behind the NBP’s strategy, presenting the views on price stability and economic growth developments that shape short-term rate policy. In addition, we argue that–amid exceptionally low inflation and the euro area’s relaxed monetary policy–the range of interest rates in a small open economy is not fully dependent on the domestic level of short-term rates. More specifically, using a formal term structure model, we show that Poland’s bond term premium has been driven to negative levels by yield-hungry foreign investors in the context of a restricted supply of short-term Treasury paper and reduced uncertainty about the future path of short-term rates. As a result, long-term yields have fallen below the expected path of future short-term rates, adding to the monetary stimulus even as policy rates remain unchanged.",

While each of these factors may have played some role, the crisis can be much more accurately described as one of ignorance than malevolence.

This article presents a new and intuitive model for modeling correlated defaults, which are the key drivers of residual credit risk in repo portfolios. In the model, default times of counterparties and collateral issuers are determined by idiosyncratic and systematic factors, whereby a name defaults if it is struck by either factor for the first time. The novelty of the approach lies in representing systematic factors as increasing sequences of random variables. Such a setting allows us to precisely capture the clustering of defaults in time and build a rich dependence structure that is free of the flaws inherent in the Gaussian copula-based approaches still widely used for portfolio credit risk applications.

They then show that many standard contracts—European equity, FX, and interest rate options—can be seen as particular examples of the Margrabe-type payoff, which allows them to analyze equity and interest rate instruments, for example, as special cases of the same general local volatility model, rather than two separate models. They then derive a Markovian projection for the general model, with an approximate local volatility diffusion for the Margrabe option underlying. Finally, they discuss a specific application …",

First, efficiency volatility estimation utilizes intraday data and measurmes such as realized volatility (i.e. sum of squared returns calculated over short, e. g 5-minute, time intervals) or realized range. Second, volatility lends itself- at least to some extent- to forecasting, where by the most efficient forecasts are those extracted from option prices quoted on the marked, which squares with the basic theory of forecasting as market expectations are based on broader set of information than backward-looking time series forecasts. Third, althought Black-Scholes opinion pricing theory was derived under the assumption of constant volatility, the approach can be fairly easily generalised to cover cases of time demendent, time and asset price dependent, and even stochastic volatility. Each of those models allows to capture some key element of the empirically observed pattern of market returns and each allows constructing a hedged option position that leads to a differential equation determining the option price (under specified boundry conditions), although not always in closed form.",

The data suggests that mark-to-market losses on many synthetic CDO tranches were much more significant than in case of simpler, lower-rated products despite the former experiencing little or no impairment of the notional. The losses were driven instead by the concentration of relatively limited number of defaults in a short period of time, suggesting that pre-crisis pricing must have seriously underestimated such risk of default clustering.
