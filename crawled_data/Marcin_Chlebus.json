In order to assess this prevalence, the thesis aims at assessing the prevalence of diabetes in the years 2010–2014 in the total Polish population by using the databases of the National Health Fund.\nMaterial and methods. In the period from 1st January 2010 until 31st December 2014 patients were distinguished according to PESEL (Personal Identification) numbers: 1. for whom health care providers have indicated diabetes-related ICD-10 codes as the main cause of the medical intervention in billing reports; 2. who had got their prescriptions filled for any hypoglycemic agents or for glucose meter test strips. The number of patients recorded as diabetes patients according to the ICD-10 code and the number of patients who had their prescriptions filled for hypoglycemic agents or test strips were assessed. On the basis of these data the prevalence of diabetes (percentage of people with diabetes in a given year or a percentage of people who had got their prescriptions filled for hypoglycemic agents or test strips in relation to the general population) in respective years and an average prevalence rate for respective voivodeships were assessed.\nResults. The average percentage of people with diabetes in the years 2010–2014 were found to be 4.47%(±0.09%).

However as usually, everything comes with a price and in this case, the price to pay is to loose interpretability of a model while gaining on its accuracy and precision. For managers to control and effectively manage credit risk and for regulators to be convinced with model quality the price to pay is too high. In this paper, we show how to take credit scoring analytics in to the next level, namely we present comparison of various predictive models (logistic regression, logistic regression with weight of evidence transformations and modern artificial intelligence algorithms) and show that advanced tree based models give best results in prediction of client default. What is even more important and valuable we also show how to boost advanced models using techniques which allow to interpret them and made them more accessible for credit risk practitioners, resolving the crucial obstacle in widespread deployment of more complex, 'black box' models like random forests, gradient boosted or extreme gradient boosted trees. All this will be shown on the large dataset obtained from the Polish Credit Bureau to which all the banks and most of the lending companies in the country do report the credit files. In this paper the data from lending companies were used. The paper then compares state of the art best practices in credit risk modelling with new advanced modern statistical tools boosted by the latest developments in the field of interpretability and explainability of artificial intelligence algorithms.

        "abstract": "Numerous advances in the modeling techniques of value-at-risk (VaR) have provided financial institutions with a wide range of market risk approaches. However, which model to use depends on the state of volatility. We present backtesting results for 1% and 2.5% VaR of six indexes from emerging and developed countries using several of the best-known VaR models, including generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH), extreme value theory (EVT), conditional autoregressive VaR (CAViaR) and filtered historical simulation (FHS) with multiple sets of parameters. The backtesting procedure is based on the excess ratio, Kupiec and Christoffersen tests for multiple thresholds and cost functions. The main contribution of this paper is that we compared the models in four different scenarios, with different states of volatility in the training and testing samples. The results indicate that the best of the models, ie, the least affected by changes in the volatility, is GARCH (1, 1) with a standardized Student 𝑡 distribution. Nonparametric techniques (eg, CAViaR with GARCH setup or FHS with a skewed normal distribution) have very prominent results in testing periods with low volatility, but they are worse in turbulent periods. We also discuss an automatic method to set an extreme distribution threshold for EVT models as well as several ensembling methods for VaR, of which the minimum VaR estimate from the best models–in particular, a minimum of GARCH (1, 1) with a standardized Student 𝑡 distribution and either the EVT or the CAViaR model–has been proven to give very good results.",

Three states of economic situation were analysed: the pre-crisis (2007), the crisis (2008) and the post-crisis (2009) period as out-of-sample.

It is important as application of Artificial Intelligence is growing rapidly and its excellent performance is of huge potential for many. There is also need for overcoming the barriers faced by analysts implementing intelligent systems. The biggest one relates to the problem of explaining why the model made a certain prediction. This work brings the topic of methods for understanding a black-box from both the global and local perspective. Numerous agnostic methods aimed at interpreting black-box model behavior and predictions generated by these complex structures are analyzed. Among them are: Permutation Feature Importance, Partial Dependence Plot, Individual Conditional Expectation Curve, Accumulated Local Effects, techniques approximating predictions of the black-box for single observations with surrogate models (interpretable white-boxes) and Shapley values framework. Our prospect leads toward the question to what extent presented tools enhance model transparency. All of the frameworks are examined in practice with a credit default data use case. The overview presented prove that each of the method has some limitations, but overall almost all summarized techniques produce reliable explanations and contribute to higher transparency accountability of decision systems.",

AIM: To define if expression of proMMP-2, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in endometrium of women with AUB is dependent on steroid sex hormone concentration and histopathological picture.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Endometrial scraps were taken from 21 women with AUB and 19 controls. Samples were evaluated in light microscopy by a certified pathologist. Activity of proMMP-2 and MMP-2 proteins levels were evaluated by gelatin zymography and TIMP-1 by reversed zymography. The results has been correlated with serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations in linear regression model.\nRESULTS: Expression: of proMMP-2 in endometrium of women with AUB is correlated with estradiol concentration and inversely correlated with progesterone levels. It was significantly higher in women with dysfunctional endometrium (p< 0.001). Expression of MMP-2 was highest in women with endometrial polyps and longer bleeding (p< 0.01), while expression of TIMP-1 was independent from hormone concentration.\nCONCLUSION: Lack of correlation between proMMP-2 and MMP-2 levels suggest different pathway of their activation in AUB. ProMMP-2 is up regulated by estradiol and down regulated by progesterone while MMP-2 levels increase with the length of bleeding.",

Quantitative analysts try to utilise them predict potential profits and risks in a better manner.

Therefore, the goal of the article is to create an effective forecasting machine learning model of daily stock returns for a preselected company characterised by a wide portfolio of strategic branches influencing its valuation. We use Nvidia Corporation stock covering the period from 07/2012 to 12/2018 and apply various econometric and machine learning models, considering a diverse group of exogenous features, to analyse the research problem. The results suggest that it is possible to develop predictive machine learning models of Nvidia stock returns (based on many independent environmental variables) which outperform both simple naïve and econometric models. Our contribution to literature is twofold. First, we provide an added value to the strand of literature on the choice of model class to the stock returns prediction problem. Second, our study contributes to the thread of selecting exogenous variables and the need for their stationarity in the case of time series models.",

Expert judgement was made on the basis of the quality of the hole, by dividing the collected photographs into the classes: “very fine,” “acceptable,” and “unacceptable.” The aim of the research was to create a model capable of identifying different levels of quality of the holes, where the reduced quality would serve as a warning that the drill is about to wear down. This could reduce the damage caused by a blunt tool. To perform this task, real-world data were gathered, normalized, and scaled down, and additional instances were created with the use of data-augmentation techniques, a self-developed transformation, and with general adversarial networks. This approach also allowed us to achieve a slight rebalance of the dataset, by creating higher numbers of images belonging to the less-represented classes. The datasets generated were then fed into a series of convolutional neural networks, with different numbers of convolution layers used, modelled to carry out the multiclass prediction. The performance of the so-designed model was compared to predictions generated by Microsoft’s Custom Vision service, trained on the same data, which was treated as the benchmark. Several trained models obtained by adjusting the structure and hyperparameters of the model were able to provide better recognition of less-represented classes than the benchmark.",

Further, the outcomes allowed us to identify the factors that influence people’s attitudes in using shared-ride technology (performance expectancy, hedonistic motivation and habit) and the intention to use this technology (effort expectancy, performance expectancy, price value, habit and trust). This study has practical implications as it has helped identify the factors that affect the acceptance of ridesharing technologies in Poland and these factors are significant for the suppliers of these technologies.

        "abstract": "In the literature, there is no consensus as to which Value-at-Risk forecasting model is the best for measuring market risk in banks. In the study an analysis of Value-at-Risk forecasting model quality over varying economic stability periods for main indices from stock exchanges was conducted. The VaR forecasts from GARCH (1, 1), GARCH-t (1, 1), GARCH-st (1, 1), QML-GARCH (1, 1), CAViaR and historical simulation models in periods with contrasting volatility trends (increasing, constantly high and decreasing) for countries economically developed (the USA–S&P 500, Germany-DAX and Japan–Nikkei 225) and economically developing (China–SSE COMP, Poland–WIG20 and Turkey–XU100) were compared. The data samples used in the analysis were selected from the period 01.01. 1999–24.03. 2017. To assess the VaR forecast quality: excess ratio, Basel traffic light test, coverage tests (Kupiec test, Christoffersen test), Dynamic Quantile test, cost functions and Diebold-Marino test were used. Obtained results show that the quality of Value-at-Risk forecasts for the models varies depending on a volatility trend. However, GARCH-st (1, 1) and QML-GARCH (1, 1) were found to be the most robust models in the different volatility periods. The results show as well that the CAViaR model forecasts were less appropriate in the increasing volatility period. Moreover, no significant differences for the VaR forecast quality were found for the developed and developing countries.",
