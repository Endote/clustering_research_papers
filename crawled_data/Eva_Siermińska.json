        "abstract": "Economic research on the determinants of gender differences in economic outcomes particularly in income and consumption is well established. Extending these investigations to other outcomes such as wealth up till now has been limited due to lack of individual-level data. Using the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) we find a significant ‘raw’ gender wealth gap of 50,000€ for married partners. Decomposition analyses reveal that the gap is largely driven by differences in characteristics between men and women (observables), particularly by individual’s own income and labour market experience. This is especially true at the bottom and at the top of the wealth distribution, which we show using semi-parametric decomposition techniques. Differences in the lower half of the distribution are mostly driven by the wealth function, i.e., the way in which women transform their characteristics into wealth.",

        "abstract": "While most studies on wealth inequality focus on the inequality between households, this paper examines the distribution of wealth within couples. For this purpose, we make use of unique individual level micro data from the German socio-economic panel study. In married and cohabiting couples men’s net worth, on average, is 33,000 euros higher than women’s. We look at five different sets of factors (demographics, income, labor market, inheritances, financial decision-making in the partnership) that might explain this wealth gap. We find that all factors contribute to the explanation of the wealth gap within partnerships, with inheritances and income being particularly relevant. Furthermore, we find that specific characteristics (e.g., self-employment, no migration background, inheritances, high income) that decrease the wealth gap for women increase it for men. For men the respective coefficients are even …",

We find that differences in characteristics (such as age, family composition, labor market attributes, etc.) between beautiful and plain people contribute to the beauty premium identified using traditional regression models. Isolating this characteristic effect from the unexplained effect using decomposition techniques leads to smaller beauty premia.",

The model is used to analyze income and wealth inequality in five OECD countries using comparable household-level survey data. We focus on the dependence parameter between the two variables and study whether accounting for wealth and income jointly reveals a different pattern of social inequality than the traditional “income only” approach. We find that cross-country variations in the dependence parameter effectively account only for a small fraction of cross-country differences in a bivariate measure of inequality. The index appears primarily driven by differences in inequality in the wealth distribution.",

        "abstract": "Equivalence scales, accounting frameworks and determination of the reference unit are all germane to measuring wealth inequality in both national and cross-national contexts Equivalence scales are used to compare the economic well-being of persons living in households with different circumstances or ‘needs,’usually those of different size. This is a standard approach used in the income distribution, consumption and poverty measurement literature. But in the wealth distribution literature there is no standard or well-defined approach to accounting for different needs as represented, for instance, by the size of households. In a 1990 paper Wolff discusses methodological issues in the estimation of size distribution of wealth. Although accounting for different household sizes is mentioned in the paper, no guide or recommendations are given. Since that time, researchers occasionally have used explicit equivalence scales in wealth studies, but there is no consensus (or discussion) regarding the appropriate approach (perhaps because of the issues raised below in section II). In their comprehensive review of the distribution of wealth, Davies and Shorrocks (1999) mention the distribution is very sensitive to the definition chosen and care must be applied when the unit of analysis is specified. Other issues such as misreporting and differential response are also discussed, but there is no broad discussion about adjusting for household size or for other related ‘needs’ or ‘intentions’. Moreover, these needs and intentions might be differentially affected by the unit of reference—person or household, and by who actually owns the wealth (eg, on gender …",
