        "abstract": "The work reported in this book was carried out over nearly a decade with most of the research undertaken during my tenure as the Director of the Migration and Development Program at Harvard University. The long time span involved in carrying out the work and the intense engagement in research and teaching have produced ample opportunities for interactions with colleagues, students, and collaborators. Many served beyond the call of duty to provide inspiration and support that led me to explore yet another dimension of labor migration. I am particularly indebted to B. Douglas Bernheim, David E. Bloom, Oded Galor, Eliakim Katz, Jennifer Lauby, David Levhari, Robert EB Lucas, Mark R. Rosenzweig, Vibhooti Shukla, J. Edward Taylor, and Shlomo Yitzhaki. The support and guidance of the Faculty Advisory Committee of the Migration and Development Program must also be gratefully acknowledged. In particU-lar, C. Peter Timmer and Zvi Griliches, chairman and committee member respectively, provided inexhaustible encouragement and invaluable help. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundatibn, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Ford Foundation have supported most of my work. I was also supported by the World Bank and the David Horowitz Institute for the Research of Developing Countries at Tel-Aviv University. It is my hope that these foundations and institutions will accept this book as a modest return for the confidence they have placed in my research. Having accounted for my academic and financial indebtedness, I would like to acknowledge the spiritual and emotional support of my wife, Shua Amorai Stark. While my passion for …",

        "abstract": "Research on the economics of labor migra-tion has undergone an exciting and signifi-cant transformation during the past few years. At a theoretical level, migration research has expanded the domain of variables that seem to impinge upon and are affected by spatial labor supply decisions; it has highlighted the role of wider social entities and interactions within them in conditioning migration behavior; it has identified new linkages between migration as a distinct labor market phenomenon and other labor market and nonlabor market phenomena; and it has contributed to our understanding of the processes of economic betterment and devel-opment. At an empirical level, recent work on the economics of labor migration has confirmed the usefulness of old and wellestablished models of labor migration. It has also provided better estimates of key behavioral parameters, many of which are im-portant ingredients in …",

        "abstract": "Despite the important role played by migrants' remittances, no systematic theory of remittance behavior exists and surprisingly little statistical evidence on determinants of remittances has appeared. This paper presents several hypotheses for motivations to remit, ranging from pure altruism to self-interest. However, a far richer array of predictions emerges from a model of tempered altruism or enlightened self-interest in which remittances are one element in a sejf-enforcing arrangement between migrant and home. This range of arguments provides a framework for interpreting evidence on remittance patterns among individual migrants in Botswana. The paper closes with some thoughts on dualistic theories of development when mutually beneficial understandings between urban migrants and rural homes prevail.\nIn examining determinants of fertility, marriage, and divorce, economists have begun to address …",

        "abstract": "A significant proportion of migration in low-income countries, particularly in rural areas, is composed of moves by women for the purpose of marriage. We seek to explain these mobility patterns by examining marital arrangements among Indian households. In particular, we hypothesize that the marriage of daughters to locationally distant, dispersed yet kinship-related households is a manifestation of implicit interhousehold contractual arrangements aimed at mitigating income risks and facilitating consumption smoothing in an environment characterized by information costs and spatially covariant risks. Analysis of longitudinal South Indian village data lends support to the hypothesis. Marriage cum migration contributes significantly to a reduction in the variability of household food consumption. Farm households afflicted with more variable profits tend to engage in longer-distance marriage cum migration. The …",

In contrast, Stark (1984) has hypothesised that rural-to-urban migration might be undertaken primarily to improve an individual's or a household's comparative income position with respect to that of other individuals or households in the relevant reference group (for example, the village).\nA recent study (Stark and Taylor, 1989) found empirical evidence that the initial relative deprivation of households in their village reference group plays a significant role in migration from Mexico to the United States. Controlling for initial absolute income and the expected income gains from migration, the propensity of households to participate in international migration was …",

Originating largely in Todaro's pioneering article, the dominance of the expected-income motive soon became virtually exclusive. 1 This is somewhat surprising, especially since during the very same period both risk and (especially) risk avoidance have assumed major significance in mainstream economics. Yet the expected-income hypothesis, even in its revised formulations, is void of any explicit decisional risk content; 2 the hypothesis does not incorporate a random variable (multiplicative or other), and the implied utility function is linear.\nConfronted with the evidence that rural-to-urban migration often results not in high-paying formal-sector jobs but in urban unemployment or employment remunerated …",

Potential gains in absolute income through migration are likely to play an important role in households’ migration decisions, but international migration by household members who hold promise for success as labor migrants can also be an effective strategy to improve a household’s income position relative to others in the household’s reference group. The findings reported in this article provide empirical support for the hypothesis that relative deprivation plays a significant role in Mexico-to-U. S. migration decisions. The findings also suggest that this migration is an effective mechanism for achieving income gains in households that send migrants to the U.S. and that households wisely choose as migrants those of their members who are …",

The need for at least some analytical clues regarding observed phenomena has partly been met by a number of recent studies that provide useful descriptive evidence and regression analyses. 4 But these endeavors fall short of a complete theory generating testable hypotheses. We have no rigorously derived answers to basic questions such as, Why do migrants remit? Why do some mi-grants remit much more than others? Why do some migrants remit for a long period of time, others for a relatively short one? Why do remitting migrants stop remitting?\nThe theory developed below views remittances as part of, or one clause in, a migrant family's self-enforcing, cooperative, contractual arrangement. Indeed, the act of migration itself is an element in this contractual arrangement. In order to understand urban-to-rural remittances, it is …",

As long as a large proportion of the population resides in rural areas, rural income inequalities must constitute an important source of overall income inequality. Changes in rural income in equalities therefore can have important implications for both social welfare and economic development. To the extent that rural incom es are lower than incomes in other sectors, concern for issues of poverty highlight the importance of the rural component of national income distribution. In addition, a deterioration in the national income distribution caused by an increase in inequalities at the low (ie rural) end may have very different economic implications, particularly with regard to investment and consumption patterns, than a …",

We achieve this under a set of fairly stringent conditions: an individual decision-making entity, a one-period planning horizon, and global risk aversion.

In this paper evidence from the Philippines is presented and analysed which suggests that the choice of migrant members and migration destination are largely determined by familial characteristics. Several interesting insights into the migration process are obtained. The standard human-capital approach explains the inverse relationship between the age of migrants and the propensity to migrate through the longer pay-off period facing the young. However, it is found that the young age of migrants can be explained by their greater amenability to familial income needs and familial manipulation. This amenability also seems to explain the preference for daughters over sons as migrants. Likewise, the initial labour-market performance of migrants is …",

As is often the case when an old approach (relative deprivation) is applied to a new area (migration),'the ideas presented here are exploratory and illustrative and have not yet been subjected to complete and formal empirical verification. Nonetheless, the usefulness of this approach in offering novel explanations to migration-related phenomena opens a promising avenue of research in a field where empirical work abounds but theory is still fairly weak (and all too often somewhat ad hoc).\nPremise a builds on the notion that people are engaged in …",

The results illustrate the robustness of earlier findings that the impacts of migration on village income distributions differ for different types of migration and for different periods in a village's migration history. The magnitude of these impacts, however, appears to be quite sensitive to the weights attached to incomes at different points in the village income distribution. For example, in a village with considerable Mexico-to-U.S. migration experience, remittances from Mexico-to-U.S. migrants have a favorable effect on the village income distribution. However, the extended Gini analysis shows that this favorable impact decreases as more weight is attached to incomes in the poorest …",
